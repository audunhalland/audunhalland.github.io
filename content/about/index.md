My name is Audun. I live in Oslo. I write code for fun and money.
When I'm not doing that, I'm likely doing one of the following things:

- Spending time with wife and/or kids
- Playing piano
- Playing guitar
- Composing music, although not very seriously
- Playing computer games
- Having a beer
- Having a coffee
- Taking a walk
- Tidying up the kitchen
- Reading mostly technical things
- Posting on this blog
- Laughing at my own jokes
- Sleeping

I'm sure there are other things I could be doing as well.

## This website
On the 25th of April, 2022 I finally pulled myself together and decided to create a blog.

It was built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).
