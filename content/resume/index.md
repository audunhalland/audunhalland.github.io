##### [2011 - 2013] Software Engineer - _Nokia_

- Productized the Nokia Asha 501, the first Nokia phone and the first truly mass produced one based on the Smarterphone Framework.
- Central contributor to the strict performance and stability requirements of the phone, resulting in it being released on time and exceeding performance expectations.
Designed and implemented the high performance Asha Contacts application, including database design, internationalization (sorting, indexing) of the phonebook list, a low memory, stream-based - import algorithm used with JSON data from social networking applications, and frame rate optimization of the scroll menu.
- Worked extensively with the graphics performance of the image framework used by the Asha Gallery, making it exceed the required targets needed for productization.

##### [2007 - 2011] Software Developer - [_Smarterphone_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smarterphone)

- Designed and implemented several key UI framework components, each being instrumental to Smarterphone later being acquired by Nokia, including but not limited to:
- Text view widget and input system: Efficient bi-directional text layout algorithms with support for most of the scripts in use in the world today (using the freetype and harfbuzz libraries) + input methods with predictive typing and complex eastern script support. The maturity of these were better than Android's at the time. Developed an extensive automated test environment for text editing/rendering
- List view widget: Used for generically displaying menus in the UI. Optimised for fastest possible scroll frame rate, while still being fully dynamic and scriptable, in a constrained embedded environment
- Part of completing the Majestic project, a feature phone approved for the South American market by Telefonica, powered by the Smarterphone Framework
- Initiated process of version management migration from CVS to Git
