The maturity of these were better than Android's at the time. Developed an extensive automated test environment for text editing/rendering
- List view widget: Used for generically displaying menus in the UI. Optimised for fastest possible scroll frame rate, while still being fully dynamic and scriptable, in a constrained embedded environment
- Part of completing the Majestic project, a feature phone approved for the South American market by Telefonica, powered by the Smarterphone Framework
- Initiated process of version management migration from CVS to Git
